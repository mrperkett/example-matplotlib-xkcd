Uses matplotlib to generate xkcd sketch style plots


## Plotting in xkcd Style
Matplotlib offers an xkcd sketch style drawing option.  If you don't know the xkcd web comic, you can check it out here:

Matplotlib also has a gallery of examples here.

Although this functionality has been available for [quite a while](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/07/10/XKCD-plots-in-matplotlib/), I wanted to experiment with it myself!  Below, I plot how the 800 meter world record has improved over time.
